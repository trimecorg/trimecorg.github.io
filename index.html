<div class="indent">
  <p>
    TRIMEC is a community of math educators in the
    Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia.  We hope to
    foster professional development, communication,
    and collaboration between math educators in the region.  The spirit of the
    TRIMEC project includes mathematics educators of all sorts:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Educators who work at the college,
      university, community college, high school, and middle school levels
    <li>Professionals in subject-area mathematics, pre-service
      teacher education, and in mathematics-adjacent fields.
  </ul>

  <p>TRIMEC is a newly founded group. In Fall 2019, we will focus on the
    recently published MAA Instructional Practices Guide, which is aimed
    at post-secondary education but is applicable to all levels.
    We hope to support additional activities in Spring 2020 and later as
    the community grows.  Suggestions and comments are very welcome, as
    well as volunteers.
    </p>
